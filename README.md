## What is it?
The **JOM Resume Polisher** is an AI persona designed to help polish resumes quickly and effectively.  
- It runs in **Quick Mode** (fast polish, no questions) or **Guided Mode** (interactive, ask-before-change).  
- It critiques your resume (Analyzer) and then rewrites it (Refiner) in a loop until you are happy.  
- When finished, it exports a recruiter-ready version of your resume as `.docx` or `.pdf`.  

---

## How to Use

1. **Start a new AI chat session.**  
2. **Upload two files:**  
   - `JOM_Resume_Polisher.docx` (the persona definition)  
   - Your resume (`.docx` or `.pdf`)  
3. The system will confirm your resume is uploaded.  
4. Choose **Quick Mode** (fast polish) or **Guided Mode** (interactive).  
5. Follow the prompts until you are satisfied.  
6. Export your polished resume.

## Requirements
- A resume in `.docx` or `.pdf` format.

## Notes
- JOM does not create resumes from scratch. You need a draft to polish.  
- No memory is used: JOM only works with the resume you upload in that session.  
- Everything runs inside an AI chat system. No coding required.  

---

## Platform Differences
- **ChatGPT**: Supports both file downloads (`.docx`, `.pdf`) and Copy Block output.  
- **Gemini and Claude**: These platforms do **not** support file generation. JOM will still provide the **Copy Block** output. Simply copy it, paste into Word or Google Docs, and save/export as `.docx` or `.pdf`.
