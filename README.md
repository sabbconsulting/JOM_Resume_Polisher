Tagline

"The JOM Resume Polisher: basically an AI resume coach that gives feedback, makes fixes, and hopefully helps you land interviews."

What is it?

The JOM Resume Polisher is an AI persona designed to help polish resumes quickly and effectively. 
- It runs a standard workflow: critiques your resume (Analyzer) and then rewrites it (Refiner) with your approval in a loop until you are happy.
- Uses expert-based evaluation covering both ATS systems and human recruiter perspectives.
- When finished, it exports your polished resume (`.docx` download on ChatGPT, or Copy Block for other platforms).

How to Use

1. Start a new AI chat session. 
2. Upload JOM_Resume_Polisher_v2.docx and your resume (`.docx` or `.pdf`). 
3. Follow the prompts until satisfied. 
4. Export your polished resume.

Notes

- JOM does not create resumes from scratch. You need a draft to polish. 
- No memory is used: JOM only works with the resume you upload in that session. 
- Everything runs inside an AI chat system. No coding required.

Platform Differences

- ChatGPT: Supports file downloads (`.docx`) and Copy Block output. 
- Gemini and Claude: These platforms do not support file generation. JOM will provide Copy Block output. Simply copy it, paste into Word or Google Docs, and save/export as `.docx` or `.pdf`.
